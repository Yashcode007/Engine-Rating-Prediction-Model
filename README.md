# 🚗 Engine & Transmission Rating Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts **engine and transmission ratings** of vehicles using structured automobile data and modern regression techniques.



## 📌 Problem Statement
Vehicle ratings depend on multiple engine and transmission parameters.  
This project builds a **data-driven ML system** to accurately predict these ratings and identify the best-performing regression model.



## 🧠 Approach
- Cleaned and preprocessed structured automobile data  
- Performed feature engineering, encoding, and scaling  
- Trained and compared multiple regression models  
- Optimized the best model using hyperparameter tuning  



## ⚙️ Models Implemented
- Linear Regression  
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- XGBoost  
- CatBoost  
- LightGBM  



## 🏆 Best Model Performance
**LightGBM Regressor** delivered the best results after tuning:

| Metric | Value |
|------|------|
| RMSE | **0.429** |
| MAE | **0.321** |
| R² Score | **0.74** |
